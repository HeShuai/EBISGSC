# EBISGSC
EPISGSC: Entropy-based method to identify tissue- or cluster-specific genes for Single Cell RNA sequencing data. The function of EPBGS package is to identify cluster-specific genes for single cell RNA sequencing data. The first core method in EPBGS is Shannon information theoretic entropy for ranking genes according to their tissue- or cluster-specificity, from normalized (tissue- or cluster-specific) expression to average expression across tissue or clusters. The second core method is Akaike information criterion (AIC). We use the AIC to accurately find cluster or tissue which the gene upregulated or downregulated in.
